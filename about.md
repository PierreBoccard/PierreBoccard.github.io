## About me

<p> My name is Pierre Boccard, I am a master student in astrophysics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) in Lausanne. I am currently doing my Master Thesis in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics of the Univeristy of Chicago under the supervision of Prof. Joshua Frieman and Anowar Shajib. The goal is to study measure the dark energy equation of state parameter from the compound lens system DES0408-5354 using the software Lenstronomy</p>

<p> I was born and raised in France by my Croatian mother and French father who are both scientists. I grew up with an older sister who is now a Doctor. I moved to Switzerland in 2018 after graduating high scool in France and received my B.S. degree in physics at EPFL in 2021. I continued my studies at EPFL by pursuing a Master degree in Astrophysics. In my spare time, I love doing photography and playing music. I'am also very into sport and currently training for a marathon.</p>
