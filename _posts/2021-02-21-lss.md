This is a full-time semester project carried out during the third semester of my master studies in astrophysics. 
* Duration: 5-6 months (February 2022 - July 2022)
* Supervisor: Jean-Paul Kneib, Andrei Variu (LASTRO, EPFL) 

### Overview

Cosmic voids are large regions of space in the Universe which have low matter densities. These structures are influenced by the expansion of the Universe and the clustering of matter. Thus, they can be used to better understand the cosmology and the large scale structure.

The purpose of this project is to test whether numerical models could be used to extract cosmological information from the clustering of voids and to perform an analysis on simulations.
The student will learn how to better code in python and how to extract information using Monte Carlo techniques and Bayesian inference methods
