This is a full-time summer project carried out between the first and second year of my master studies in astrophysics. 
* Duration: 2 months (July 2022 - August 2022)
* Supervisor: Aymeric Galan, Frederic Courbin (LASTRO, EPFL) 

### Overview

This project focuses on a gravitational lens system formed by a group of galaxies at redshift z = 0.422 lensing a bright background galaxy at redshift z = 2.001. The main peculiarity of this system is the presence of a luminous satellite near the Einstein radius, that slightly deforms the giant arc. 
The goal was to first study the system using the [Lenstronomy software](https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy) developped by S. Birrer to obtain a modelisation of the background galaxy using shapelets. We then swtiched to the [SLITronomy software](https://github.com/aymgal/SLITronomy) developped by A. Galan of EPFL, to reconstruct both the source and lens galaxies using a wavelet decomposition.

Here are two of the best models that we obtained using Lenstronomy and SLITronomy with also the observational data to compare it. In order to determine which model is the best one and if one is better than the other we computed for every model the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) but we also look at the residual and the magnification model for example.
