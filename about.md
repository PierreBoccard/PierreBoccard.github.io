## About me

<p> My name is Pierre Boccard, I am a master student in astrophysics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) in Lausanne. I am currently working full time on a project with Prof. Courbin at EPFL. The project focuses on gravitational lensing using N-body hydrodinamical simulations from the IluustrisTNG project. </p>

<p> I was born and raised in France. I moved to Switzerland after graduating high scool in France and received my B.S. degree in physics at EPFL in 2021. In my spare time, I love doing photography and playing music. I'am also very into sport and is currently training for a half-marathon.</p>
