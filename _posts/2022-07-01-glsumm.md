This is a full-time summer project carried out between the first and second year of my master studies in astrophysics. 
* Duration: 2 months (July 2022 - August 2022)
* Supervisor: Aymeric Galan, Frederic Courbin (LASTRO, EPFL) 

### Overview

This project focuses on a gravitational lens system formed by a group of galaxies at redshift z = 0.422 lensing a bright background galaxy at redshift z = 2.001. The main peculiarity of this system is the presence of a luminous satellite near the Einstein radius, that slightly deforms the giant arc. 
The goal was to first study the system using the [Lenstronomy software](https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy) developped by S. Birrer to obtain a modelisation of the background galaxy using shapelets. We then swtiched to the [SLITronomy software](https://github.com/aymgal/SLITronomy) developped by A. Galan of EPFL, to reconstruct both the source and lens galaxies using a wavelet decomposition.
