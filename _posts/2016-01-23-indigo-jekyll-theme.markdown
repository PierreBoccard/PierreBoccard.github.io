This is a semester project carried out during my master studies in computational science and engineering at EPFL. 
* Duration: 5 months (September 2021 - January 2022)
* Supervisor: Bogdan Kulynych (Spring lab, EPFL) 

### Overview

Most galaxies contain a supermassive black hole (SMBH) between a few millions to a few hundreds of million times the mass of the Sun. These SMBH accrete mass at the very center of their host galaxy, a process that emits tremendous amount of light. This is called a quasar, which luminosity can outshine that of its host galaxy. But how do the properties of quasars relate to the ones of their host galaxies, in particular their mass properties? Do quasars power galaxies? Or are they formed only in the most massive galaxies? Many of the answers to those questions rely on relations between the mass of SMBH and their host galaxy and their evolution with redshift. We propose to use existing hydrodynamical cosmological simulations to establish such relations, with particular focus on the dark matter content of quasar host galaxies, as this is now a measurable quantity thanks to gravitational lensing.
